# Python Package Example

This project simply contains some mechanisms for Python pip packages I learned and I want to keep 
for the future :)

So this README is packaged when building the package, so it should contain some information about the package and the usage.

It is also used as the `long_description` in [setup.cfg](setup.cfg) for the package.
